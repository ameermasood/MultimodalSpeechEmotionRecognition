# IEMOCAP Dataset

This folder is reserved for the **IEMOCAP (Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture)**
dataset.

IEMOCAP contains acted and semi-natural conversational speech with emotion labels.
In this project, IEMOCAP is primarily used for **evaluation and generalization
testing**, as it better reflects real conversational scenarios.

IMPORTANT: The actual audio files are NOT included in this repository. The dataset must be obtained separately due to licensing restrictions.
